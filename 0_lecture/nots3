Trees -->
LinkedList without the constraints that each node 
points to a single other node

Free To point to multiple other nodes. 

Terminology
Root --> upmost node in the Trees
Child -> a node directly connected to another node when 
moving away from the node
Parent -> A node directly connected to another node when moving towards the Root
Siblings -> Nods that share the same parent are considered Siblings
Leaf- > a noda that does not have any children of its own

In LL are a type of Trees


                        O     <-root
                     /  |  \
                   O    O    O
                  / \  / \  / \ 
                 O   OO   OO    O <- leaves


            all values in the left subtree are less than the value at the given node
            all values on he right are greater than or equal to the value at the given node 

DOM is a giant tree structure
                 
                 recursion --> uses stack behind the scene. 

Traversal --> operation in which each node of a data structure such as tree is "visited". 

Depth First Traversal (DFT) and Breadth First Traversal (BFT)
